## Brainstorming
Our UX survey research revealed that our target users are primarily younger developers starting out in their career who already have social media integrated into their lives. Users showed interest in sharing their GitHub or Youtube links (or their other portfolios), seeing different code tips and tricks, and a reliable privacy policy. With the most popular type of media content being photo, our app utilizes upload image function to easily share visualizations.
